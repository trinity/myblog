Simple bootstrapped blog engine. This is a work-in-progress, so yes, it is missing a lot of things currently.

This is pretty much done for fun when I have spare time and to mainly refresh my memory :)

TODO list:
- Unit tests
- Form validation
- Logging
- Configuration for Mongo's authentication
- Improved comment system/post adding/etc.
- Template improvements
- ...and the list goes on :)

Technologies used:
- Spring MVC
- Spring Security
- Spring Data
- MongoDB
- JQuery
- Twitter Bootstrap
